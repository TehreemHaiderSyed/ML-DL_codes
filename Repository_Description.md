This repository contains a collection of machine learning and image processing projects that I have worked on. It includes implementations using various techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-means clustering, and Linear Regression. The projects cover tasks like image classification (cats vs dogs), gesture recognition, housing price prediction, and clustering customer data based on spending scores. These projects utilize Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code also includes feature extraction, model training, performance evaluation, and data visualization techniques.
